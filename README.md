### Academic Integrity

- Please read IIT's [Academic Honesty Policy](http://www.iit.edu/student_affairs/handbook/information_and_regulations/code_of_academic_honesty.shtml)
- All work you turn in must be done by **you alone**
- You may not look at the solution of any other student prior to the due date.
- All violations will be reported to `academichonesty@iit.edu`.
- The first violation will result in a failing grade for that assignment/test. The second will result in a failing grade for the course.


### Late Submission Policy

- Late assignments will **not** be accepted, unless:
  - There is an unavoidable medical, family, or other emergency; **and**
  - You notify me **prior** to the due date.

### Objectives

1. Provide practical and theoretical understanding of syntactic parsing
2. Provide practical and theoretical understanding of probabilistic approaches to text classification, parsing, and discourse processing
3. Provide practical and theoretical understanding of latest neural network learning methods for language processing.


### Contribution to general objectives

a. An ability to apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the discipline.  
c. An ability to design, implement and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs.  
f. An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.  
i. An ability to use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practices.  
j. An ability to apply mathematical foundations, algorithmic principles, and computer science theory in the modeling and design of computer-based systems in a way that demonstrates comprehension of the tradeoffs involved in design choices.
